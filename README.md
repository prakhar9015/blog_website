# blog-website 🎸

This is a blog website, i created it as a project while learning from Dr. Angela Yu, on Udemy.
<br>
I find this platform as a form of self expression, i never knew that i could write blog posts,
that was somewhere hidden inside of me.
<br>
Thankyou Dr. Angela yu for this wonderful project , i am always grateful for it 💙
